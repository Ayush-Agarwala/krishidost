#Pashu Doctor - AI-Driven Livestock Health Management Platform
##Project Overview
Pashu Doctor is an innovative platform designed to revolutionize livestock healthcare in India. The platform leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist farmers in monitoring and managing the health of their livestock. By utilizing predictive models, Pashu Doctor helps diagnose cattle diseases early, ensures timely treatment, and enhances overall livestock productivity.

##Problem Statement
India has a significant livestock population of 536.76 million, contributing 4.9% to the nation's GDP and 28.4% to the agricultural GDP. As the largest global milk producer, the health of this vast livestock plays a critical role in the country's economy. However, farmers face challenges in timely disease diagnosis and access to veterinary healthcare. This project aims to bridge that gap through data-driven solutions that offer real-time insights and personalized disease diagnosis.

##Our Mission
